## üöÄ Overview
GRAP is a üéâ simple, yet powerful programming language designed to make programming more intuitive and accessible. It is built using C and Python, and it allows you to write programs in a graph-like structure, making it easier to visualize the flow of data and control.

## üåü Key Features
- **üìä Graph Structure**: Write your programs in a graph-like structure, making it easier to visualize the flow of data and control.
- **üíæ Memory Management**: Graph provides a simple memory structure for storing and retrieving variables.
- **üì¢ IO Module**: The language includes built-in support for basic input and output operations.
- **üé¨ Interpreted Language**: Graph is an interpreted language, which means you can run your programs directly without needing to compile them first.

## üìú Example Code
Here's a simple example of a Graph program:

```grap

mem | save | ( var | "pi"    | "3.14"  )
mem | save | ( var | "greet" | "hello" )
io  | say  | "PI is equal to:"
io  | say  | ( mem | get | "pi" )
io  | say  | "A greeting is:"
io  | say  | ( mem | get | "greet" )
io  | say  | "That is it for today! Goodbye!"
```

This program saves the values "3.14" and "hello" to the variables "pi" and "greet" respectively. It then prints out the values of these variables.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with Graph, you'll need to clone the repository and build the interpreter. Detailed instructions for this process can be found in the `INSTALL.md` file.

## üìö Documentation
For more detailed information about the language, including its syntax and built-in functions, please refer to the `DOCS.md` file.

### More Examples

```grap
module | declare | @sayhello
module | export | (
    mem | save | (
        var | "pi" | "3.14338"
        )
    )
module | export | (
        io | say | "This is inside the function"
    )
module | export | (
    io | say | (
        mem | get | "pi"
        )
    )

io | say | "This is a regular call"

@sayhello | call | ()
```

Would look something like this in the interpreter:
![moduleimage](./demos/module.png)

And would output this as a result:
> This is a regular call 
> 
> This is inside the function
> 
> 3.14338
